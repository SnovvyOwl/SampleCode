# Sample Code
## Matlab Sample Code
###  with E2BOX EBIMU 9 dof V4

#### AHRS.m
This code measure ANGLE of RPY, and Angular Velocity by AHRS(E2Box EBIMU 9 DOF V4).
The AHRS uses Serial communiction with RaspberryPI zero W.
The RaspberryPI zero W is connectied Matlab by WIFi

#### IMU_GUI.m
This code is not Succesfull code. Because It Can Read data From AHRS(E2Box EBIMU 9 DOF V4). But I can't Calculate exact Trajectory..
AHRS is Connected my Computer directly by Serial Communiction.
